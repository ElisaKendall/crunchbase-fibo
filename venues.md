## Semantic Web Journal

SWJ categories. For all categories there are [specific guidelines](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors) in particular regarding review criteria:
- original research: full paper
- comprehensive overview of state of the art: survey
- description of a (usually, RDF) dataset): dataset description
- description of an ontology: ontology paper
- description of an application with third party use: application report
- description of a deployed tool/system with third party use: tool/systems report

I contacted SWJ editors at contact@semantic-web-journal.net:
- Could you please take a quick look and tell me whether it's worth submitting to SWJ, and in which category? I think the best fit is "Ontologies", although it doesn't describe a new ontology but the vagaries of mapping to an existing family of ontologies (FIBO). If not, I'll completely understand and seek a semantic fintech workshop or similar. If you think it has a chance, I'll format it properly according to submission guidelines.
- Answer: Tricky. We take our submission categories very seriously, i.e. it would have to be rewritten to really fit one. So the main question is: what's the contribution? Skimming what you linked, it's not clear to me where this would fall. You'd certainly have to rewrite it in one direction or the other.
that
- Thanks for the prompt reply! I'll look for another venue.
